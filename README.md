### Whack-A-Mole Game
#### Built using vanilla JavaScript.
##### This is a version of the classic Whack-A-Mole arcade game. 
##### I started coding this project while completing freeCodeCamp's "Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games" and then improved upon it with some additonal styling and several bug fixes such as:
##### 1. The game timer did not reset once a round was completed. 
##### 2. 2. The game score did not reset between rounds. 
##### After finding solutions for these problems, a user could complete multiple rounds of the game without refreshing the browser. 
##### While working on this project, I also gained experience with: 
##### - JavaScript
##### - DOM Manipulation
##### - HTML5
##### - CSS3
##### - Flexbox
